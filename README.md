# 🪐SATURN EXPEDICION
 An expedicion that didn't end well...
## 🌟 Highlights
- **Console-based adventure**
- **Time loop mechanics**
- **Escape room elements**
- **Detailed map to explore**

## ℹ️ Overview

My FIRST proper console game, so please be nice! 🥺

In this game, you step into the shoes of Markus, a spaceship engineer. Your ship has been struck by a meteor, and your goal is to deal with the disaster.
You can either be selfish and save only yourself, or be a hero and save your entire crew. The choice is yours.

I am a beginner in programming and I still have a lot to learn, but I'm enjoying the process!

## ❓How to start the game

It's very simple: just go to `Main.java` and click **Run**.

If you want to play the game from a **JAR file**, you'll need to open **CMD** or **PowerShell** on your PC, navigate to the folder, and type:
```bash
java -jar your_file_name.jar
```
